Relatively simple way to scrape the number of Github contributions for one or more years.
This gets the data from the HTML in the  profile page which also allows us to look at different
years.

This was quicker to write than to check if it was available in a package.
However, for more detailed analysis such as the number of edits and files involved in each commit,
we probably want to find existing options.
